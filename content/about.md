## Research Interests

Yamaguchi has a large interest in neuroscience, especially higher functions of brains.

How a brain thinks, hence the mechanism under reasoning, understanding, and knowledge handling by brains still remains unclear.

His goal is to uncover the whole functional connectivities, neural circuits, etc. from both the mathematical, biological points of view, and truly to understand HOW BRAINS WORK.

Hikaru Yamaguchi has long been dreaming of the creation of a perfect natural intelligence.
